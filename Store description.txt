Geohashing lets you explore your environment at a randomly generated location, each day!

Features:
* Calculate the geohash for any location and date
* Show the nearest geohash, instead of that of your current graticule
* Pin locations to the start screen - the tiles are updated with map images and distance information
* Send the geohash to the Maps app for navigation instructions
* Open source!

What is geohashing? Geohashing is an algorithm that generates a random location in your general area each day, based on the Dow Jones of that day (so each day it's a surprise where it lands).
The location is the same for all people in that area, so it's also a great way to meet new people who are also interested in geohashing.
